All of the data they aggregate are published in the [Systema Globalis](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/blob/master/README.md). Their goal is \"to compile all public statistics; Social, Economic and Environmental; into a comparable total dataset.\" All data sets in this project are copied directly from the Systema Globalis without any changes.\n",

Instead, it measures how long someone would live, on average, if the *mortality conditions* in that year persisted throughout their lifetime. These \"mortality conditions\" describe what fraction of people at each age survived the year. So, it is a way of measuring the proportion of people that are staying alive, aggregated over different age groups in the population."

Whilst the 1991 disaster will undoubtedly have impacted the growth in the population during and after this period, reducing the number of people available to concieve during these years, the change in life has increased from 45 as an average life expectancy in 1970 to 70 in 2010 (as shown in the graph above).  [Wikipedia's 1980's Bangladesh ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s_in_Bangladesh#Demographics) attributes the reduction in the population to a decrease in the fertitilty rate (births per woman) from 6.4 to 4.7."
